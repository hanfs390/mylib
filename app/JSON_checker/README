JSON_checker is a Pushdown Automaton that very quickly determines if a JSON text is syntactically correct. It could be used to filter inputs to a system, or to verify that the outputs of a system are syntactically correct. It could be adapted to produce a very fast JSON parser.

JSON_checker is made up of these files:

Filename	    Description
JSON_checker.c	The JSON_checker.
JSON_checker.h	The JSON_checker header file.
main.c	        A sample application.

Accessories
utf8_to_utf16.c	 A UTF-8 to UTF-16 converter.
utf8_to_utf16.h	 The UTF-8 to UTF-16 converter header file.
utf8_decode.c	 A UTF-8 decoder.
utf8_decode.h	 The UTF-8 decoder header file.

JSON_checker comes with a test suite. If the JSON_checker is working correctly, it must accept all of the pass*.json files and reject all of the fail*.json files.
